<summary>How I've used my skills</summary>
Whilst at Bournemouth University I have edited the video and audio for many projects. You can view them all here. <!-- Make sure to add links to project folders -->
I am currently undertaking a Skills Bootcamp in Software development where I have already begun to code Python files for tasks which can also be viewed in their own repositories. <!-- Continue to add successful tasks to github -->
I have also used my own digital marketing and public relations skills to help focus the ideas behind the very same projects that I edited as mentioned above.
Lastly thanks to presentation and public engagement requirements throughout my education I can comfortable speak and engage with audiences and groups of people.
